		// Variables in Java or any programming language are storage containers
		// A storage container shall contain data :)
		
		// Single Value Storage Container
		// Can store only 1 value
		// eg: username
		
		// Multi Value Container
		// Can Store more than 1 value
		// Either Homogeneous (Same Type) or Hetrogeneous (Different Trype)
		// instagram -> upload album of all images -> homo
		// instagram -> upload album of images and videos -> hetro
		
		// Que -> Is Shopping Cart in an eCommerce Platform
		//        SVC, MVCHo, MVCHe, All of them ?
		//        Data Structures: How optimally we structure the data in containers
		//		  Put shirts on one after other -> Stack Arrangement
		
		// 1. Containers come with Size
		// 2. Containers in Programs are temporary i.e. are stored in RAM
		//    The moment your program finishes, data is lost :(
		//    But we can persist data in permanent storage spaces may be in cloud storage -> DataBase :)
		
		// fionnasAge is variable name i.e. storage container name
		// 10 is literal or data which will be stored in the memory
		// int decides the type (integral number) of storage container along with the size (32 bits)
		
		// *******>>>>>> local variable/storageContainer i.e. it belongs to main
		int fionnasAge = 10;
